Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

As a Computer Science major on the Data Science track, I am interested in 
taking this class because it will offer me foundational understanding of 
key concepts, tools, and techniques that are essential for this field of 
work. The course will give me a hands-on experience with real-world 
datasets, enhancing my problem-solving skills and knowledge in programming 
languages like Python and SQL. Furthermore, the course covers statistical 
analysis, data visualization, and data management which are things I am 
deeply interested in and prepares me for advanced courses I will need to 
take later on as well as career opportunities.
